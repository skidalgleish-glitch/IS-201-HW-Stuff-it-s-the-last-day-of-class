  <h1>Plo Koon – Lightsaber Style & Power</h1>

  <h2>Lightsaber Fighting Style</h2>
  <p>
    Plo Koon primarily uses **Form V (Shien / Djem So)**, a lightsaber form known for 
    powerful counterattacks and strong defensive blocks. Form V users redirect an 
    opponent’s strikes and turn defense into offense, using precise footwork and 
    controlled strength. Plo Koon is also skilled in **Ataru (Form IV)**, which adds 
    mobility and acrobatics when needed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Form V – Shien:</strong> Great for blocking blaster fire.</li>
    <li><strong>Form V – Djem So:</strong> Used for overpowering enemies in duels.</li>
    <li><strong>Form IV – Ataru:</strong> Jumps, flips, and fast movement when required.</li>
  </ul>
